# Network Architecture

Refers to the technologies that support the infrastructure.
Four characteristics that need to be addressed:
- Fault Tolerance
- Scalability
- Quality of Service (QoS)
- Security

## Fault Tolerance

Limits the impact of failure by limiting the number of affected devices.
Reliable networks implement a packet switched network:
- Packet switching splits traffic into packets
- Each packet could (theoretically) take a different path to the destination

Not possible with circuit-switched networks.

## Scalability

A scalable network can expand quickly and easily.
Network designers follows accepted standards and protocols.

## Quality of Service

Is the primary mechanism used to ensure reliable delivery of content.
With a policy in place the router can more easily manage the flow of data and voice traffic.

## Network Security

Two main types:
- Network infrastructure security
	- Physical security of devices
	- Preventing unauthorized access to devices
- Information Security
	- Protection of information or data transmitted.

Three goals:
- Confidentiality - only intended recipients can read the data
- Integrity - assurance that the data has not been altered
- Availability - assurance of timely and reliable access to data
