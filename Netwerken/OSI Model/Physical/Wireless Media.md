# Properties of Wireless Media
Carries electromagnetic signals representing binary digits using radio or microwave frequencies.

Limitations:
- Coverage area - Effective coverage can be impacted by physical characteristics of deployment location.
- Interference - susceptible to interference
- Security - Wireless communication coverage requires no access to physical strand of media.
- Shared medium - WLANs operate in half-duplex, only one device can send or receive at a time. Many users accessing simultaneously results in reduced bandwidth for each user.

# Types of Wireless Media

Wireless Standards:
- Wi-Fi - WLAN technology
- Bluetooth - WPAN standard
- WiMAX
- Zigbee

# Wireless LAN

requires following devices:
- Wireless Access Point (AP) - Concentrate wireless signals from users and connect to existing copper-based infrastructure
