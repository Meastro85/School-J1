# Characteristics of Copper Cabling

Most common type of cabling
- Inexpensive
- easy to install
- low resistance to electrical current

Limitations:
- Attenuation - The longer electrical signals travel, the weaker they get.
- Electrical signal is susceptible to interference from two sources (Electromagnetic Interference and Radio Frequency Interference)
Mitigation:
- Strict adherence to cable length limits
- Metallic shielding and grounding
- Twisting opposing circuit pair wires together

# Types of Copper Cabling
## Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)

- most common media
- terminated with RJ-45 connectors
- interconnects hosts with [[Network components#Intermediary Network Devices |Intermediary Network Devices]]

Key Characteristics of UTP
1. Outer jacket protects wire from damage
2. Twisted pairs protect from interference
3. Color-coded plastic insulation isolates wires from each other and identifies each pair

## Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)

- Better noise protection than UTP
- More expensive than UTP
- Harder to install than UTP
- Terminated with RJ-45 connectors
- interconnects hosts with [[Network components#Intermediary Network Devices |Intermediary Network Devices]] 

Key characteristics of STP
1. Outer jacket protects wire from damage
2. Braided or foil shield provides EMI/RFI protection
3. Foil shield for each pair of wires
4. Color-coded plastic insulation isolates wires from each other and identifies each pair

## Coaxial Cable

Consists of:
1. Outer cable jacket to prevent damage
2. Woven copper braid, or metallic foil, acts as second wire and as a shield
3. Layer of flexible plastic insulation
4. Copper conductor transmits electronic signals
