# Properties of UTP Cabling

Four pairs of color-coded copper wires.
No shielding is used.
Relies on the following properties to limit crosstalk:
- Cancellation - Each wire in a pair uses opposite polarity. One is negative the other is positive.
- Variation in twists per foot in each wire - Each wire is twisted a different amount.
