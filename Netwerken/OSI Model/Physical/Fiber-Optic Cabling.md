# Properties of Fiber-Optic Cabling

Not as common as UTP
Transmits data over longer distances at higher bandwidth
Less susceptible to attenuation, immune to EMI/RFI
Made of flexible, extremely thin strands of very pure glass.
Uses laser or LED to encode bits as pulses of light
Fiber-optic bale acts as a wave guide to transmit light between two ends with minimal signal loss

# Type of Fiber Media

Dispersion refers to the spreading of a light pulse over time. Increased dispersion means increased loss of signal strength.

MMF > dispersion than SMF

## Single-Mode Fiber

- Very small core
- Uses expensive lasers
- Long-distance applications

## Multimode Fiber

- Larger core
- Uses less expensive LEDs
- LEDs transmit at different angles
- Up to 10Gbps over 550 meters

# Fiber-Optic Cabling Usage

Used in four types of industry:
- Enterprise Networks - Used for backbone cabling applications and interconnecting infrastructure devices
- Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) - Used to provide always-on broadband services to homes and small businesses
- Long-Haul Networks - Used by service providers to connect countries and cities
- Submarine Cable Networks - Used to provide reliable high-speed, high-capacity solutions at up to transoceanic distances.
