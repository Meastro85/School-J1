3 Functional areas:
- Physical Components
- Encoding
- Signaling

## Physical components

Hardware devices, media and other connectors that transmit signals representing the bits.

- NICs, interfaces, connectors, cable materials and cable designs

## Encoding

- Converts stream of bits into a format
- provides predictable patterns recognizable by next device

## Signaling

- Represents the bit values "1" and "0" on the physical medium
- Varies based on type of medium

# Bandwidth

- Capacity at which a medium can carry data
- Digital bandwidth measures how many bits can be transmitted in a second
- Physical media properties, current technologies and laws of physics determine available bandwidth

## Bandwidth Terminology

Latency
- Amount of time for data to travel from one point to another.
Throughput
- Measure of transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time
Goodput
- Measure of usable data transferred over a given period of time
- Goodput = Throughput - traffic overhead
